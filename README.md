Diabetes-Treatment-analysiss
Diabetes is a medical condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 patients in the United States. According to Ostling et al, patients with diabetes have almost double the chance of being hospitalized than the general population (Ostling et al 2017).   Therefore, we would be creating a model, which will focus on: 
1.The hospitals are evaluating efficiency of Insulin based treatment for patients, recommend if solo insulin treatments work well towards the above stated objective. We would be focusing on the result of insulin on different age groups  
2. For a new patient, given his medical history and characteristics, should we recommend  solo insulin or a conjunction of other drugs/ treatment?
